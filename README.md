# Recipe_Cards_Android_App

**Recipe Cards** is a lightweight Android app for managing your personal collection of recipes. Think digital index cards in your pocket. Whether you’ve inherited treasured family recipes or you’re building your 
  own collection, Recipe Cards makes it easy to capture, browse, and organize everything in one place.

## Key Features

- **Scrollable List of Cards**  
  Each recipe appears as a card showing its name, a thumbnail image (or default placeholder), and the first four ingredients for a quick glance.

- **What You Want, When You Want**  
  Description, notes, and instructions are all housed in drop-down menus. No more scrolling past a short movel to find the ingredients list and essential information you need.

- **Add & Edit Recipes**  
  Tap the floating “+” button to create a new recipe: give it a name, photo from your gallery, description, notes, steps, servings, and asd many ingredients as you like, and editing an existing card just as easy.

- **Search & Filter**  
  Quickly search by recipe name. Use the include and exclude filters to narrow results to recipes that contain or lack specific ingredients. This is ideal for planning around whats in your pantry or avoiding allergens.

- **Delete & Persist**  
  Remove cards with a single tap. All recipes are stored locally so your recipes remain intact even if you close or restart the app.

  No more paper cards lost in the drawer or battling an onslaught of advertisements on the web. Just transcribe recipes you like, and make them your own through iteration or even create them yourself.
